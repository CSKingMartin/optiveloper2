# Project Minotaur

![Minotaur](src/static/images/minotaur-color.png)

## What am I?
- I am a new prototype for a low-profile, config-light build system for hosting styleguide applications.
- I use Next.js, Babel, PostCSS, and a few other technologies
- I have aspirations of being integrated alongside a headless CMS

## How can I help?
If you have interest in contributing to a lonely, open-soure project please contact me (@CSKingMartin) directly through my Github contact info.

## Getting Started
Getting an idea of what `project-minotaur` is all about, just do the following:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Travel to the root directory of `project-minotaur` and run:
```
yarn
yarn dev
```
3. Travel to `https://localhost:30000`

It's as simple as that.

As of now, Minotaur is no longer near finished, but the `master` branch will be kept clean. We will have periodic merges made from `dev` into `master` at key benchmarks, or at discretion.
