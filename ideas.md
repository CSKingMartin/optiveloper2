- Kate says they're only really useful organizers for developers (I'm inclined to agree).
	- BIG: Kate would like the ability to be able to manage groups of components, pages, etc.

	- this could look like a 'data-tree' showing the inhertiance paths?
	- aka, atom A + atom B = molecule C

### Global Header
- potentially 2 solutions, one for the styleguide app shell + one for the 'pages'
	- branding of Minotaur is important here to visually differenciate
