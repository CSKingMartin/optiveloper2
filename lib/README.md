# Lib (Library)

The 'lib' directory holds helper functions used for the styleguide / build system only.
Lib can be referenced by '@lib' anywhere within the Styleguide source directory.

### Notes:
- Currently there is no 'styleguide' portion of this application. Once compilation of
the styleguide application comes together, the 'src' directory will likely be renamed
to 'styleguide.
