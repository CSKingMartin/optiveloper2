  ### Catalog

  The Catalog encloses the Components that makeup the Styleguide.

  The Components are divided into a few categories that represent their size.

  We use some ideas and conventions from Brad Frost!

  You can find more of his work [here](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/)!

  ##### Atoms

  Atoms are the tinest building blocks of any web page. For a good number HTML tags, we have an atom
  in our Catalog to represent it.

  A good example is the Button:

  <Button>Press me!</Button>

  But Buttons don't do much on their own!

  ##### Molecules

  When we pair our Button with another component, or some other pieces, it's classified as a Molecule.
  Here we have an Expandable, which uses two Atoms; Button and Image.

  Try interacting with the example below
  ### ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡

  <Expandable
    toggleElement={<Button>Press me!</Button>}
    closeHeight="0"
  >
    <Image height="300px" src="static/images/bab5.gif" alt="So it begins!" />
  </Expandable>

  ##### Organisms

  Organisms are larger still. They represent page-level modules that sometimes have many moving parts, but
  are categorized more for their impact and size on the web page.

  These are typically large, body-wide elements such as Heros, Calculators, as well as GlobalHeaders and Footers.

  ##### Templates

  Templates are composition of Organisms filled with Lorep Ipsum, or other dummy text that represent a
  full page without the content.

  These are akin to wireframes, and can represent default compositions used for authors in a CMS.
