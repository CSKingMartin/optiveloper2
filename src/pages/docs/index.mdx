# Project Minotaur
##### A low-profile Component Catalog App.

Minotaur is a small React application built around hosting and developing a cohesive Styleguide for all kinds of Web Development.
Categories help organize these components based on their size and purpose.

##### For Example:

Most Websites include basic Components like Cards, Headings, and Buttons.

Here we can compose all of those (inline inside an MDX file) to serve as a live example:

<Card>
	<Rhythm>
		<Heading>Hello, Minotaur!</Heading>
		<Button>This is an exciting composition!</Button>
	</Rhythm>
</Card>

This directory should hold the basic documentation for the Styleguide application.

Detailed descriptions of how certain processes work, what specific (complex) components do.

### Pillars of the Application:

- Styleguide appication

What does this do? This:
	- Generates pages authored by user
	- Exposes props in Full Examples to edit every component
	- Stores / uses Templates
