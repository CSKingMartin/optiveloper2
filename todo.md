### Ideas

##### Atomic Categories
- Kate says they're only really useful organizers for developers (I'm inclined to agree).
	- BIG: Kate would like the ability to be able to manage groups of components, pages, etc.
- Sara suggested either making that relationship more pervasive and available throughout the system.
	- this could look like a 'data-tree' showing the inhertiance paths?
	- aka, atom A + atom B = molecule C

- Devin suggests making React bundling into the production build be optional
	- Clients don't always want
	- Makes client aware
	- too hard to rip out

### BUGS:
- svg sprite for Icons no longer working
- ./pages/catalog/atoms|molecules|organisms => These directories are not cleaning out old pages on rebuild
- bad re-render bug inside of Specimen / Hanga components
